# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: November 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: New git and Freshing up my JS and planning

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
